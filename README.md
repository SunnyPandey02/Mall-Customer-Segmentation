# Mall Customer Segmentation

## Project Overview
This project focuses on designing a customer segmentation model using machine learning techniques to analyze purchasing behavior and demographic information. The primary goal is to group customers into distinct segments, allowing businesses to implement personalized marketing strategies and optimize customer engagement.

---

## Features
- **Clustering Algorithms:** *Applied K-Means clustering to identify meaningful customer segments.*
- **Data Preprocessing:** *Cleaned and transformed data for effective modeling.*
- **Visualization:** *Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and visualize customer segments.*

---

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** *Python*
- **Libraries:**
  - *NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation*
  - *Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization*
  - *Scikit-learn for implementing the clustering model*

---

## Dataset
The dataset used contains information about customers, including:
- *Gender*
- *Age*
- *Annual Income (k$)*
- *Spending Score (1-100)*

---

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - *Handled missing values (if any)*
   - *Scaled features for uniformity*
2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):**
   - *Visualized data distributions and relationships*
   - *Used scatter plots and pair plots to reveal trends*
3. **Modeling:**
   - *Applied K-Means clustering with varying values for k*
   - *Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters*
4. **Evaluation:**
   - *Analyzed clustering results through visual plots*
   - *Interpreted customer segments based on demographics and purchasing patterns*

## Conclusion
*The project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for customer segmentation, offering valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies.*

---

## Future Improvements
- *Incorporate additional features such as purchase frequency and product categories.*
- *Test and compare different clustering algorithms like DBSCAN and hierarchical clustering.*
- *Build a web-based dashboard for real-time customer insights.*
